# pm-prototype-demo

Plan B fitness prototype (static HTML/CSS/JS) global map.

## 1) Project Positioning

- This repo is a static prototype focused on Plan B product flow validation.
- Core implementation pattern:
  - Multiple independent HTML entries (split-by-screen pages)
  - Shared stylesheet modules under `css/`
  - Shared interaction/data script under `js/`
- Main interaction logic is centralized in `js/plan-b-verify.js`, then activated by each page via `data-plan-b-page`.

## 2) Top-Level Structure

```text

│  └─ plan-b-verify.js                 # shared interaction + page bootstrap
├─ index-plan-b-home.html              # home (split-page mode)
├─ plan-b-all-training.html            # all training list page
├─ plan-b-plan-detail.html             # plan detail page
├─ plan-b-move-detail.html             # move detail page
├─ plan-b-immersive-workout.html       # immersive workout page
├─ plan-b-free-training-pilates.html   # pilates free training page
├─ plan-b-training-report.html         # training report page
├─ plan-b-profile.html                 # profile page
└─ free-training-strength-temp.html    # temporary strength demo page
```

## 3) Page Map (Global Screen Navigation)

### 3.1 Page Identity (`data-plan-b-page`)

- `index-plan-b-home.html` -> `home`
- `plan-b-profile.html` -> `profile`
- `plan-b-all-training.html` -> `all-training`
- `plan-b-plan-detail.html` -> `plan-detail`
- `plan-b-move-detail.html` -> `move-detail`
- `plan-b-immersive-workout.html` -> `immersive`
- `plan-b-free-training-pilates.html` -> `pilates`
- `plan-b-training-report.html` -> `report`

`js/plan-b-verify.js` reads:

- `document.body.dataset.planBPage`
- and conditionally initializes the corresponding modules.

### 3.2 Typical Flow (Split-Page Mode)

1. Home (`home`) browse cards/list
2. Enter move detail (`move-detail`)
3. Start immersive workout (`immersive`)
4. End session -> report (`report`)
5. Return to home/profile (`home` / `profile`)

Parallel entrances:

- Home/Profile -> All Training (`all-training`)
- All Training(Plans) -> Plan Detail (`plan-detail`)
- Home/Profile -> Pilates (`pilates`)

## 4) CSS Responsibility Map

Shared by major Plan B pages:

- `css/plan-b-base.css` - base layout, shell, global component foundations
- `css/plan-b-modal-detail.css` - modal + move detail related visuals
- `css/plan-b-profile.css` - profile screen styles
- `css/plan-b-immersive.css` - immersive workout visuals/interactions
- `css/plan-b-pilates-report.css` - pilates + report related style layer

Additional/legacy style files (for comparison, migration, or temporary screens):

- `css/base.css`, `css/home.css`, `css/immersive-workout.css`, `css/pilates.css`
- `css/training-report.css`, `css/screens-profile-move-shell.css`
- `css/tokens-overrides.css`
- `css/plan-b-verify.css`

## 5) JavaScript Responsibility Map

## `js/data/explore-library.js`

- Provides demo card/library data (`window.PlanBDemo.libraryData`)
- Provides asset fallback list (`window.PlanBDemo.assetPaths`)
- Must be loaded before `js/plan-b-verify.js`

## `js/plan-b-verify.js`

Main responsibilities:

- Page bootstrap based on `PLAN_B_PAGE`
- Explore grid rendering (category/filter)
- Move detail open/close and data sync
- Immersive workout control (mode/weight/equipment/chart/drawer interactions)
- Training report data assembly and rendering
- Pilates dashboard simulation and training timer
- Cross-page navigation wiring (home/profile/all-training/report routes)

State/storage anchors:

- `STORAGE_AD_META` (`planBAdMetaV1`)
- `STORAGE_REPORT_PAYLOAD` (`planBReportPayloadV1`)

## 6) Key Contracts (Do Not Break)

- Every new/adjusted page should explicitly set `data-plan-b-page`.
- Keep script load order:
  1) `js/data/explore-library.js`
  2) `js/plan-b-verify.js`
- Keep shared element IDs/class names stable when reusing existing JS logic.
- If changing page file names, update hardcoded `window.location.href` targets in `js/plan-b-verify.js`.
- Plans in `js/plan-b-all-training.js` should route to `plan-b-plan-detail.html?planId=<id>`; non-plan tabs keep move detail routing.

## 7) Change Workflow (Recommended)

When adjusting any feature, follow this sequence:

1. Define target page key (`home`, `profile`, `immersive`, etc.)
2. Confirm impacted HTML entries
3. Confirm impacted CSS modules (base vs feature-specific)
4. Locate related JS block in `js/plan-b-verify.js`
5. Verify route jump + state persistence (`localStorage`) behaviors
6. Run end-to-end flow checks:
   - Home -> Move Detail -> Immersive -> Report -> Back
   - Home/Profile tab switching
   - All Training entry and return path
   - Pilates independent flow

## 8) Suggested README Maintenance Rules

- Add/remove page: update **Section 2 + Section 3** together.
- Add/remove style file: update **Section 4** and note ownership.
- Add/remove JS module: update **Section 5** and load order contract.
- Route/state changes: update **Section 3.2** and **Section 6**.

## 8.1) Global Design Tokens (Persistent Spec)

- Global UI tokens are defined in `css/plan-b-base.css` under `:root` and should be treated as the source of truth.
- For plan-detail meta tags, use the `--plan-meta-*` token family (category label + value color), and avoid hard-coded color literals in feature CSS.
- Naming convention:
  - Category token: `--plan-meta-cat-<category>-label`
  - Value token: `--plan-meta-<category>-<value>-<property>`
- Current covered categories for plan detail:
  - `scene`: Strength Training / Pilates / Cardio Fat Burn / Stretch Recovery
  - `cycle`: 2 Weeks / 3 Weeks / 4 Weeks
  - `sessions`: 3 Sessions / 4 Sessions / 5 Sessions
  - `difficulty`: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
- When adding new business values, first add the corresponding token in `css/plan-b-base.css`, then map class names in feature CSS.

If you keep this document aligned with each iteration, it serves as a stable project navigation map for future refactors and UI experiments.

## 9) Change Log Template

Use this section to keep iteration records in one place.

### 9.1 Logging Rules

- Add one entry per change batch (or PR/task).
- Keep entries reverse chronological (newest first).

### [2026-10-20] Camera-position immersive presentation
- **Page**: `plan-b-immersive-workout.html`. Review baseline `docs/references/strength-camera-v2.html` is unchanged.
- **New page-only resources**: `css/plan-b-immersive-camera.css`, `js/plan-b-immersive-camera.js`, `assets/strength-training-frame.png`, and three images in `assets/immersive-camera/`.
- **Shared bridge**: `js/plan-b-verify.js` keeps the existing entry-recognition sequence, drawer, Flip/Pause/End and navigation. The camera module starts only after recognition success. Embedded drawer equipment buttons are excluded from handle pointer capture on this demo page.
- **Interaction**: click the top image (or use Enter/Space) to reveal another target-position fixture with the same point animations as the reference. Each shuffled batch contains all three states. Pause stops the clock and target animation. Flip retains its existing behavior of mirroring the full-screen demonstration background.
- **Layout**: the original full-screen screenshot remains; bottom metrics, title and gray gradient sit above the collapsed drawer and action dock. Expanded drawer may cover these metrics. No shared CSS is modified.
- **Simulation boundary**: there is no real capture/inference API. Images are AI-generated and points are preset; all fixtures/events are managed in the camera module. Report payloads carry `isSimulated` and `dataSource: "camera-position-simulation"`, with a visible simulated scene label. No invented AI form score is reported. Only the time advances; the other three fixture values remain constant, as in the reference.
- **Validation**: use the existing manual browser workflow for the entry overlay, three states, pause/flip, drawer controls, Home → Detail → Immersive → Report → Home, and representative unchanged pages.
- **Verified**: original scanning/failure/success/auto-close sequence; all three randomized image states; target animations; pause/resume; Flip; all four resistance modes, parameter slider, weight steps, equipment and chart tabs; 390px layout separation and keyboard/reduced-motion behavior; Home → Detail → Immersive → Report → Home at 1080×1920. Report is explicitly simulated, omits AI form score, and preserves the fixture energy value. Home/Profile/All Training/Pilates smoke checks had no page script errors and did not load the camera module or stylesheet.
- **Limits**: the three camera images and target coordinates are presets, not live capture/recognition. Intro recognition remains the original timed simulation. No real-device testing or deployment was performed.
